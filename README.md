1. On a laptop or remote device such as a raspberry pi install opencv and anaconda with python. Pip install the necessary imports from the program.
2. On the same laptop or desktop install python and install python flask using pip along with the other imports within the program.
3. On the same device which the flask server is installed, install MYSQL database
